# Artificial_Neural_Network
ANN on simple data:

              Neural Network considers the input columns or input features on which 
  it is trained as input layer, so there is no need to explicitly add input layer.
  We can add any no of hidden layer and between input layer and output layer.
  The output layer contains nodes or neurons equal to the number of categories 
  in the dependent variable.
